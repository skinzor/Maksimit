1RM Calculator
==============

This is a simple 1RM calculator for all the weight training enthusiastic SailfishOS users out there. Calculator uses 7 different prediction equations for estimating your 1RM performance from repetitions to fatigue.

1RM stands for "One Repetition Maximum" and in weight training it is the maximum amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise.

Instructions to use this calculator:
------------------------------------

Before you can calculate your estimated 1RM you have to lift a set with a weight you can lift up fully to a maximum of 10 repetitions. Then select the amount of weight lifted and the number of reps completed and hit 'Calculate my 1RM' to get your estimated ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM!

Safety tips:
------------

There are always risks when you're handling heavy weights. Be sure always to warm up and stretch your muscles and joints properly before the workout and especially when attempting your 1RM. It's always a good idea to ask a friend to act as a spotter to support your lifts. Stay hydrated and listen to your body to prevent injuries; you don't want to break yourself.

In conclusion:
--------------

Workout safely and regularly, have fun and good luck on attempting those 1RMs! :-)
