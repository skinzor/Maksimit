Maksimit
========

A perfect app for planning your gym workouts. As a native 1RM and rep max calculator for Sailfish OS Maksimit is a must have app for all the weight training enthusiastic Sailfish OS users out there.

Calculator uses 7 different prediction equations for estimating your 1RM and rep max performance from repetitions to fatigue. Remember that the results are not 100 % accurate and the degree of accuracy can vary between different weight training exercises as well as the weight training experience and muscular composition of the trainee.

Instructions to use this calculator:
------------------------------------

Before you can calculate your estimated 1RM you have to lift a set with a weight you can lift up fully to a maximum of 12 repetitions. Then select the amount of weight lifted and the number of reps completed and hit the calculate button. On the results page swipe left to view percentages table.

You can also calculate your maximum repetitions when you know your 1RM. On the main calculator page you find a rep max calculator from the pull-down menu. Select your 1RM and desired number of reps and hit the calculate button.

Safety tips:
------------

There are always risks when you're handling heavy weights. Be sure always to warm up and stretch your muscles and joints properly before the workout and especially when attempting your 1RM. It's always a good idea to ask a friend to act as a spotter to support your lifts. Stay hydrated and listen to your body to prevent injuries; you don't want to break yourself.

In conclusion:
--------------

Workout safely and regularly, have fun and good luck on attempting those 1RMs! :-)
